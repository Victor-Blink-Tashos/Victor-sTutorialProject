The game I am aspiring to create is a third person action game where the player character goes room to room fighting hordes of enemies with a wide assortment of weapons. The player character will also have a jump, a dodge for a quick burst of movement in a direction, a block that has a limited number of damage it can take before it gives in and drops guard, and a buff button that gives the player stronger moves at the expense of mana while held down.

Gameplay consists of walking into a room, enemies will appear in the room, the player has to fight off the enemies, and then the player moves on to the next room which will be a bit harder.  Once all of the rooms have been cleared, the player beats the level.
